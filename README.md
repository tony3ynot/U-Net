# U-Net
Implementation of U-Net model architecture based on the original paper [Ronneberger, et al. "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation". 2015.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).  Did not include inference process, and needs to be pre-trained on ImageNet for actual training.
